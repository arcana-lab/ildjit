---------------------------------------------------
AIKA -> AIKA: Ildjit Keeping Application |
	Advanced Ildjit Keeper named AIKA
---------------------------------------------------
This is the installer for the ILDJIT system

During the installation you will be requested to specify the path to some directories:

1. Source Directory: the folder where you want to download the ILDJIT source code.

2. PnetLib Installation Directory: the folder where you previously installed PnetLib
(distributed inside the Portable.NET project).
You can download it from: 

http://www.dotgnu.org/pnet-packages.html

3. Installation Directory: the folder where you want to install ILDJIT.

Before the actual installation you can specify some configuration options.

At the end of the installation you will be asked if you want to upgrade your .bashrc file
with the new environment variables. The following lines will be appended:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:ILDJIT_INSTALLATION_PATH:ILDJIT_INSTALLATION_PATH/lib:ILDJIT_INSTALLATION_PATH/lib/iljit
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:ILDJIT_INSTALLATION_PATH/lib/pkgconfig
export PATH=$PATH:ILDJIT_INSTALLATION_PATH/bin
export ILDJIT_PATH=PNET_INSTALLATION_PATH/lib/cscc/lib

This modification is strongly recommended in order to have your ILDJIT immediately available.

Please do not modify the source folder after the installation. In particular do not modify the
names of the folders, in order to preserve the actual installed version.

---------------------------------------------------

While performing upgrade or rebuild be sure to specify the correct source and installation folders.
During the upgrade please specify the same configure options of the previous installed version.
You can obtain them with 'iljit -C'.
